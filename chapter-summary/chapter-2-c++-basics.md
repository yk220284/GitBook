# Chapter 2 C++ Basics
1. _single_ bolean statment \(pg 109\) in cpp doesn't require `{}`
    
    ```cpp
    if (Boolean_Expression)
        Yes_Statement
    else
        No_Statement
    ```
    
2. `do-while` loop \(pg 119\)

   ```cpp
   do
   {
   Statment1;
   Statment2;
   } while (Boolean_Expression);
   ```

3. multi-line comment \(pg 126\)

   ```cpp
   /* several
   line */
   ```

4. `NAMED_CONSTANT` \(pg 128\)

   use _modifier_ `const` to modify/restricts the variables being declared.

   ```cpp
   const int N = 10;
   ```

5. numerial operations between `int` results in `int`.
